# AI Content Disclosure - Digital Life Hub

## Overview

Digital Life Hub is committed to transparency about how content is created. This document outlines our use of AI-assisted content generation and our commitment to quality, accuracy, and authenticity.

## What is AI-Assisted Content?

AI-assisted content means that articles were created using AI writing tools (like ChatGPT, Claude, or similar) as an aid in the writing process. However, **all content is:**
- ✅ **Reviewed and fact-checked** by humans before publication
- ✅ **Tailored specifically** for the Ghana context
- ✅ **Never claiming personal experiences** we don't have
- ✅ **Clearly labeled** when AI assistance was used

## Why We Use AI

1. **Consistency**: Produce content regularly without relying on personal experiences
2. **Accuracy**: Focus resources on research and fact-checking rather than writing
3. **Objectivity**: Avoid first-person bias and unverifiable claims
4. **Transparency**: Be honest about how content is created instead of pretending to personal expertise we don't have
