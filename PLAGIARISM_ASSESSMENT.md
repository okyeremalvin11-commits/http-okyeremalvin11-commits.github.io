# Plagiarism Assessment Report

## Summary
No direct copy-paste plagiarism detected. However, several articles contain **suspicious first-person claims that are unlikely to be authentic**, typical of AI-generated content.

---

## Red Flags Found

### High-Risk Articles (Likely AI-generated or misleading claims)

1. **"MTN vs Vodafone: Night Data Bundles"** (article.html, ID 8)
   - Claims: "I tested both networks for 30 days", "I tested download speeds in 3 locations in Accra"
   - Specific data: exact Mbps speeds, GH₵ pricing, "dumsor" context
   - **Issue**: Verifiable test data presented as personal research (not easily fact-checkable)

2. **"Koko and Koose: Ultimate Ghanaian Breakfast"** (article.html, ID 7)
   - Claims: "As someone who grew up in Northern Ghana", "In my family, we serve..."
   - **Issue**: Personal anecdotal claims with no way to verify authorship

3. **"How to Win Local FIFA Tournaments in Ghana Gaming Cafés"** (article.html, ID 9)
   - Claims: "After winning 3 local tournaments, I'm sharing the strategies..."
   - **Issue**: Unverifiable personal achievement claim

4. **"How I Landed My First Tech Job in Ghana Without a Degree"** (article.html, ID 13)
   - Claims: "No computer science degree... Just 8 months of focused learning"
   - **Issue**: Specific timeline and achievement claim

5. **"5 Mobile Games That Actually Pay Real Money in Ghana"** (article.html, ID 14)
   - Claims: "After testing dozens of 'earn money' games..."
   - **Issue**: Unverifiable testing claim

### Medium-Risk Articles (Original content but generic structure)

- "Jollof Rice Recipe", "Banku & Tilapia", "Fufu & Light Soup" — genuine recipes but structure is formulaic
- "Best Gaming Setup Under $500" — budget breakdowns could be researched/compiled from other sources
- "Mobile Games That Pay" — could be compiled from app store reviews

### Low-Risk Articles (Likely original)

- Basic tutorials: "Build Your First Website", "Password Security"
- How-to guides: "Street Food Safety", "Data Saving Tips"
- These use standard technical info + personal teaching style (authentic-sounding)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Most likely scenario**: Articles were generated or heavily modified by AI, which:
- Creates plausible but unverifiable personal narratives
- Adds specific numbers/pricing to seem authoritative
- Uses idiomatic language ("trust me", "As someone who...", "I discovered")
- Doesn't copy entire articles, so plagiarism detection misses it

**Alternative**: Human author(s) writing with AI assistance, inflating personal experience for credibility.

## Risks for AdSense Approval

Google AdSense reviewers may:
- **Flag misleading content**: Ads cannot run on pages with false/unverifiable claims
- **Reject "thin content"**: Articles claiming personal testing without proof
- **Enforce E-E-A-T**: Expertise, Experience, Authority, Trust (articles fail on "Trustworthiness")

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Add Author Attribution**
   - Include byline: "By [Author Name]" with brief bio
   - If written by AI, **disclose it** (Google prefers honest AI disclosure over hidden AI)

2. **Fact-Check High-Risk Claims**
   - Remove or rewrite unverifiable claims ("I tested...", "Top 3 winning strategies...")
   - Replace with verifiable data: "According to recent reports...", "Studies show..."

3. **Rewrite or Disclaimer**
   - For articles claiming personal experience: either make them genuine or add: "This is a hypothetical scenario based on common user experiences"

### Optional (Recommended for AdSense)

4. **Add "Fact-Checked" Labels** to articles with verifiable data
5. **Link to Sources** (Wikipedia, news outlets, official docs)
6. **Reduce First-Person Claims** where possible

## Examples of How to Fix

**Current (Risky):**
> "After winning 3 local tournaments, I'm sharing the strategies that work..."

**Fixed (Verifiable):**
> "Based on common patterns observed in competitive FIFA tournaments and feedback from players, here are strategies that work..."

## Code / Structure Assessment

**Good News**: 
- `script.js`, `style.css`, and HTML structure appear to be **original or standard boilerplate** (not plagiarized)
- No copy-paste from known frameworks without attribution
- Custom article system is unique

---

## Bottom Line

**For AdSense**: Rewrite high-risk articles to remove unverifiable claims or add AI disclosure. The site's plagiarism risk is **LOW** (no copy-paste), but **credibility risk is MEDIUM-HIGH** (unverifiable personal narratives may trigger reviewer skepticism).

Would you like me to:
1. Rewrite 2-3 high-risk articles with fact-based language?
2. Add AI disclosure notices?
3. Convert first-person claims to general tips without attribution?
